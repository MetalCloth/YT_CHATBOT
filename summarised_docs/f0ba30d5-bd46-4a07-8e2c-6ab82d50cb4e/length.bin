After making changes and pushing them to the fork, the speaker explains how to create a new pull request on GitHub. This involves hitting the 'New pull request' button, opening a PR on the parent project with the changes made in the fork, and leaving a comment if the PR resolves an issue. The goal is to successfully complete the easy part of contributing and then wait for feedback and reviews.ÿÿÿÿ
