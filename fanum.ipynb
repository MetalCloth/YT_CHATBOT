The focus starts with Mesmer, son of Marika and elder brother to possibly Melina, who was cursed from birth with the Abyssal Serpent that ate away at his kindling. Marika sealed the curse by plucking out his right eye and placing a seal of Grace, then sent him on a crusade to the shadow realm to purge the hornsent people who had murdered her bloodline. Mesmer was accompanied by shunned allies including Commander Gaius and his army, as well as knights from renowned families and Rellana. After killing countless hornsent and impaling them on spears, Mesmer was abandoned by his mother, leading him to desperately pluck out his own eye and release the Abyssal Serpent in his final moments while calling for his mother.\",\\n    \"start_time\": \"00:00:00\",\\n    \"end_time\": \"00:01:57\"\\n  },\\n  {\\n    \"title\": \"The Dancing Lion\",\\n    \"summary\": \"This section explains the lore of the Dancing Lion boss, revealing it to be two hornsent warriors in a costume performing a sacred ritual. Horned warriors who excelled in combat could become Divine Beast Warriors, and those skilled in divine invocation became sculpted keepers who wore lion costumes and performed the lion dance ritual. These keepers were messengers of the heavens who used divine invocation to call upon spiritual forces, which gave them their power. However, during Mesmer\\'s crusade, most of these hornsent were targeted, impaled, and burned, causing their graceful ritual dance to be transformed into a form of attack driven by revenge against Mesmer.\",\\n    \"start_time\": \"00:01:58\",\\n    \"end_time\": \"00:03:01\"\\n  },\\n  {\\n    \"title\": \"Romina, Saint of the Bud\",\\n    \"summary\": \"Romina was the saint of a church in the ancient ruins of Rauh, whose symbol was a bud. After Mesmer\\'s crusade burned her church to the ground, leaving her as the sole survivor, she discovered a twisted divine element that she wove into the Scarlet Rod. This transformation likely started the rot religion seen throughout the world and caused the spiders to swell in size.

During the crusade, Rellana fought fiercely at Mesmer\\'s side and became known as \\'The Sword of Mesmer.\\' She uniquely combined the power of moon and flame magic, distinguishing her magical abilities.

However, these signs stopped coming and she was abandoned by the Greater Will. Despite this abandonment, she continued producing two fingers, desperately trying to find messages that no longer existed. This reveals the major twist that Marika was guided by two fingers that were producing nonsense rather than actual divine communication, meaning the entire Golden Order was based on false guidance from a broken system.\",\\n    \"start_time\": \"00:05:48\",\\n    \"end_time\": \"00:07:22\"\\n  },\\n  {\\n    \"title\": \"Bayle the Dread\",\\n    \"summary\": \"Long ago, Bayle challenged Dragonlord Placidusax to an epic battle that left both severely injured.

After the battle, Bayle retreated to the shadow realm, prompting dragons loyal to Placidusax to hunt him. Bayle and his descendants (the Drakes) became sacrifices for dragon communion warriors who would consume their hearts to gain power.

They overran his mansion, tortured his servants, and executed him with the sword of damnation, piercing his body with golden barbs that inflicted eternal agony. His lady Nanaya told him to endure, so he resisted the madness.
